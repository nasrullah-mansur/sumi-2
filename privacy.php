                        <p>This policy outlines the purpose and nature of the personal data Nexsus Creative collects and retains; what, why and how this is collected, what is done with that information and how long we hold it for. It also outlines an individual’s rights in relation to their personal information.

                        <p>
                            Nexsus is considered to be both a Data Controller (determining the purposes in which any personal data is to be processed) and a Data Processor (holding data collected by our clients). We comply with the principles of data protection enumerated in the SA General Data Protection Regulation. We will therefore be lawful, fair and transparent in our use of personal data.

                        <p>An individual has the right to request information on the personal data Nexsus hold for them. We have mapped out the places in which data is kept so can make prompt replies, by email or telephone to requests. <br><br>
