                                Well… in a nutshell, back in 2004 we initially set up Amasci Multimedia Solutions. The business grew and after establishing ourselves in the web design and creative market we became VAT registered (May 2007). We then took the business to the next level by becoming incorporated in April 2008, changing our full trading name to Amasci Creative Limited.

                            As a small business just starting out, Amasci took all of the worry away from the design of my website. I was amazed at the quick response times, the creativity of the design and the general help and support throughout the building and development of the site. I’ve had some fantastic comments from customers, friends and family regarding the design of the website and I can’t really take any credit for that - it was all down to Amasci!
