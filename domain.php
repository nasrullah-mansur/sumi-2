                        <h2 id="one">1. Domain Registration and Ownership</h2>
                        <p>You understand and acknowledge that the Registrant also referred as Registered Name Holder, whose name is on record, will have sole legal ownership of the Domain. It is your sole responsibility and not that of Nexsus Creative, in any way, to ensure that the proper Registrant name is recorded</p>
                        <p>At the point in which we register a domain, we will ask all the required information for the registration to take place. As part of the Registration process, you must provide certain information and promptly update the information to keep it true, correct, accurate, current, and complete. You must provide or confirm the following information when registering your Domain:</p>
                        <p>•	The full legal name and postal address, email address, voice telephone number of the Registrant (the domain owner/holder), even if you opt-in for Private Whois (Domain Privacy) service; name of authorized person for contact purposes in the case of an Registered Name Holder that is an organization, association, or corporation;</p>
                        <p>•	The domain being registered; </p>
                        <p>•	Any other data that any Registry may require to be submitted to it, including, specific information regarding the primary purpose for which a domain is registered. </p>


                        <h2 id="two">2. Renewal Policy</h2>
                        <p>All domains are renewed automatically on an annual basis, unless a specific agreement has been made in writing to register your domain for a longer period. If you do not want one of your domain names renewed you need to put this notification in writing by email to <a href="#">creative@nexsus.co.za</a> at least 7 days before the renewal date. Your renewal date can be found on your domain renewal invoice or the ’Who is’ database.</p>
                        <p>Email reminders will be sent to customers/registrants. Domain renewal invoices are sent on or around the 1st of the month prior to the month of that in which the domain expires (e.g a domain that expires on 14th October will receive a renewal invoice on or around 1st September). A reminder is sent 15 days after the first invoice, again on 33 days then every 3 days after that. Reminders will be sent using the email address held on account. It is the registrant’s responsibility to check all contact details are up to date.</p>

                        <p>If you request that you no longer wish to have your domain name renewed, or if you fail to request a renewal, it will be left to expire. In the case of ZA extensions your domain name will then go into a 30 day protected period, after which it will be suspended by ZA Registry. If you change your mind and still wanted to retain your domain name, this must be requested by email before the 30th day after your domain has expired. After 30 days your domain will be cancelled and deleted from the register and made available for resale.</p>




                        <h2 id="three">3. Domain Transfers</h2>
                        <p>If you wish to transfer a domain to a new provider, please put this in writing to <a href="#">creative@nexsus.co.za</a>, clearly stating the new IPS Tag. You will receive an email confirming that your instruction has been carried out, or if there is any further information we require from you to carry out the instruction. There is no fee for transferring a ZA domain name. A charge of $20+VAT will be made for all international domains.</p>

                        4. Abuse & Complaints Procedure
                        </h2>
                        <p>Please direct all domain issues and complaints to <a href="#">creative@nexsus.co.za</a>. This will be dealt with as soon as possible, but always within 5 working days.</p>
                        <p>If your complaint is regarding a ZA domain name and you are not happy with the initial outcome of your complaint, you can escalate your issue to ZA Central Registry (the .za registry) <a href="#">here</a>.</p>
